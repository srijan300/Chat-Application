## 🛠️ How It Works

QuickChat uses a **Socket.IO** based implementation to maintain a **bidirectional, real-time channel** 📶 between the client and the server. When a user sends a message:

1. The message is instantly emitted to the server via a **WebSocket** event 🧭.
2. The server broadcasts the message to the target user(s) in real-time 📤.
3. Users receive messages **instantly**, without refreshing their browser ⏱️.
